# Opioid Mortality Trends in the United States (1999–2020)

**Tools:** R, Data Wrangling, Time-Series Analysis, Visualization

This project analyzes opioid-related mortality trends across time and geography in the United States using CDC WONDER "Multiple Cause of Death" data (1999–2020). The analysis explores national trends, identifies changes in slope over time, and investigates geographic variation in opioid-related deaths.

### Key Components
- Cleaned and filtered CDC WONDER mortality dataset, handling suppressed and missing values.
- Explored multi-decade national trends, identifying periods of accelerated growth in opioid-related deaths.
- Conducted geographic comparisons across states to identify regional differences in mortality.
- Created time-series and comparative visualizations to communicate trends clearly.
