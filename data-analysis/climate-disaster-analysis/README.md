# Climate Change and Natural Disaster Severity (1979–2011)

**Tools:** R, Data Wrangling, SQL, Time-Series Analysis, Visualization  
**Datasets:** CDC (temperature records), NOAA NCEI (natural disasters)

This project explores long-term U.S. temperature trends and investigates whether rising temperatures correspond with changes in the frequency or severity of natural disasters.

### Key Components
- Cleaned and merged temperature data (1979–2011) with natural disaster records (1980–2011).
- Computed average temperatures from high/low monthly readings for each state.
- Constructed time-series plots showing warming trends across decades.
- Analyzed disaster frequency and economic cost to identify long-term patterns.
- Examined correlations between temperature changes and disaster occurrence/severity.
